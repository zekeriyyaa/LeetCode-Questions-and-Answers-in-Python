"""
Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
